# A Study on the Cognitive Impact of Vestibular Dysfunction on English Listening Comprehension Based on EEG Signals



## Overview

Vestibular dysfunction is known to impact cognitive processes, yet its specific effects on English listening comprehension remain underexplored. This research investigates the cognitive interplay between vestibular impairments and auditory linguistic processing using EEG signals. By integrating innovative frameworks and strategies, the study aims to enhance comprehension accuracy and cognitive engagement for individuals with vestibular impairments.

### Key Contributions
1. **Dynamic Auditory-Linguistic Encoding Network (DALEN)**: 
   - A unified framework for auditory feature extraction, linguistic encoding, and cognitive adaptation.
   - Dynamically analyzes real-time EEG responses to auditory stimuli.
2. **Adaptive Listening Enhancement Strategy (ALES)**:
   - Tailored interventions including:
     - Signal adaptation.
     - Contextual enrichment.
     - Cognitive training.
   - Mitigates adverse effects of vestibular dysfunction on auditory processing.
3. **Experimental Results**:
   - Demonstrated significant improvements in comprehension accuracy and cognitive engagement using the proposed approach.
4. **Neural and Vestibular Insights**:
   - Highlights the importance of incorporating vestibular and neural considerations into listening comprehension frameworks.
